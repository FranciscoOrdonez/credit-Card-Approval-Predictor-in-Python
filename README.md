# credit-Card-Approval-Predictor-in-Python
Automated  Credit Card Approval Predictor for Commercial Banks

In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. Most of this notebook has been studied from the project in Datacamp: Predicting Credit Card Approvals.  Part of the project has been done by Datacamp and the programs have been completed by the author.

We'll use the Credit Card Approval [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/)  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository . The structure of this notebook is as follows:

First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

**1. LOAD AND VIEW DATA SET. SEE CODE [HERE](coding/load-data)**

We find there are fifteen columns:

 0      1      2  3  4  5  6     7  8  9   10 11 12     13   14 15
 
0  b  30.83  0.000  u  g  w  v  1.25  t  t   1  f  g  00202    0  +

1  a  58.67  4.460  u  g  q  h  3.04  t  t   6  f  g  00043  560  +

2  a  24.50  0.500  u  g  q  h  1.50  t  f   0  f  g  00280  824  +

3  b  27.83  1.540  u  g  w  v  3.75  t  t   5  t  g  00100    3  +

4  b  20.17  5.625  u  g  w  v  1.71  t  f   0  f  s  00120    0  +

And the structure is as follows: 

Number of Instances: 690

A.  Number of Attributes: 15 + class attribute

B.  Attribute Information:

    A1:	b, a.
    A2:	continuous.
    A3:	continuous.
    A4:	u, y, l, t.
    A5:	g, p, gg.
    A6:	c, d, cc, i, j, k, m, r, q, w, x, e, aa, ff.
    A7:	v, h, bb, j, n, z, dd, ff, o.
    A8:	continuous.
    A9:	t, f.
    A10:	t, f.
    A11:	continuous.
    A12:	t, f.
    A13:	g, p, s.
    A14:	continuous.
    A15:	continuous.
    A16: +,-         (class attribute)

C.  Missing Attribute Values:
    37 cases (5%) have one or more missing values.  The missing
    values from particular attributes are:

    A1:  12
    A2:  12
    A4:   6
    A5:   6
    A6:   9
    A7:   9
    A14: 13

D.  Class Distribution
  
    +: 307 (44.5%)
    -: 383 (55.5%)

**2. Inspecting the applications**
The output may appear a bit confusing at its first sight, but let's try to figure out the most important features of a credit card application.  The probable features in a typical credit card application are Gender, Age, Debt, Married, BankCustomer, EducationLevel, Ethnicity, YearsEmployed, PriorDefault, Employed, CreditScore, DriversLicense, Citizen, ZipCode, Income and finally the ApprovalStatus. 
Using the output below, we can see that the outcome values in Approved are ‘+’ or ‘-’ for whether credit had been granted or not. These character symbols aren’t meaningful as is so will need to be transformed. Turning the ‘+’ to a ‘1’ and the ‘-’ to a ‘0’ will help with classification and logistic regression models later in the analysis.

As we can see from our first glance at the data, the dataset has a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features. 

To inspect the data we use pandas commands: structure, info and tail [HERE](coding/inspect)

The output is:

The dataset also contains values from several ranges. Some features have a value range of 0 - 28, some have a range of 2 - 67, and some have a range of 1017 - 100000. Apart from these, we can get useful statistical information (like mean, max, and min) about the features that have numerical values.

**3 Changing '?' with 'NaN'**
The dataset has missing values, which we'll take care of in this task. The missing values in the dataset are labeled with '?', which can be seen in the last cell's output:

 0      1       2  3  4   5   6      7  8  9   10 11 12     13   14 15
673  ?  29.50   2.000  y  p   e   h  2.000  f  f   0  f  g  00256   17  -

Now, let's temporarily replace these missing value question marks with NaN. See code [here](coding/missing1)
